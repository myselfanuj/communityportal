# Community Portal
### This repository is for creating a community platform for all members of GirlScript Foundation.</br>
#### GirlScript is a section-8 not for profit company registered under Governement of India.</br>
We welcome new ideas for the portal. Although the platform must include the following-</br>
* A login page for community members, leaders and admins.
* Dashboard for everyone's profile with their basic info and ratings given by admins.
* Admins are the core team members of the foundation and will rate the profiles on the basis of contributions.
* Leaders will automatically be eligible for giving ratings to other members after getting a 3 star profile out of 5.
* A form for submitting new details of an upcoming event by local chapter, submitting the videos, photos, social media post links, feedback, statistics in the same form upon completion and also for submitting the swag request and proposed statistics before event and uploading contact details csv file.
* A page for all chapters listing their contribution, photos, leader name and team profiles.
* A page for branding guidelines and community code of conduct.
* Prompting all leader profiles for submitting bimonthly reports.
* A list of all upcoming and past events and a button to RSVP for upcoming events and writing feedbacks for event attended.
* A leaderboard to see which leader has made the most contributions and can be promoted to higher role of responsibility.</br></br>
